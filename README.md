[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/W3okDjLLWxE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3okDjLLWxE)
<p>A pinball table with some interactable objects. Nothing fancy but with some work could end up a pinball game.
<p>The bumpers are a little rebelious and need some love, but it is playable.
<p>Left and right control bumpers, up stores strenght on the ball launcher, finally up and down control the camera view.
<p>Still needs some indicator that it is fully charged.
